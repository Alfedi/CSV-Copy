* Copy CS
This script alows you to get some columns of a ~.csv~ and copy them into another ~file.csv~

** Usage
   Run the script and it will be asking for some parameters and then... MAGIC.

** License
   Do whatever you want with this script. I only made to learn some python basics and I was boring.
